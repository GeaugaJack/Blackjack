So I did not figure out from the tutorial i watched on how to distinguish an Ace card from being counted as a 1 or a 11 (which is what happens in Blackjack)
Also I have to learn how to make sure it continues and maybe count a theoretical earnings number?
Dealer draws at 16 or under, need to figure that out. Dealer stays at 17 and over.
Error discovered: Dealer had two 11s and busted from the beginning but i could not escape the command until i busted. Had to kill the command.
